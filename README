OrionNodeRiak

A Node-based server database front end for Sproutcore.

Features: 
 - Websocket support
 - Long polling support (might be a bit buggy still)
 - Session support
 - Policy (role-based permissions) and record filtering support
 - Authentication support (async)
 - Easy to implement custom storage modules (example mySQL, Riak and OrionDB storage modules included)
 - Automated updates pushed to connected clients

Written with a SproutCore application in mind. (http://www.sproutcore.com)

Status: Between alpha and beta status...  
	Two datasources, one for Websockets and one for XHR long polling are included. Both can be found in clients/SproutCore
	
	What works: 
		- WebSocket connections in a WebSocket enabled browser (still problems with FF4.01beta though)
		- Long Polling XHR
		- Authentication from userdata in a file
		- Session support
		- Automatic distribution of changes based on users previous requests
		- support for sending queries to the server
		- support for custom storage modules, such as fixtures
		- SC.DataSource client code for both XHR long polling and Websocket
		- MySQL support (you need the mysql client and bindings from my node-mysql-mysqlclient fork)
	
	What still needs to be implemented:
		- support for more Riak features in requests to the server
		- additional authentication modules
		- binary data support

Many thanks to Jeff Pittman (geojeff) and juan77 for their continuing support and willingness to test and catch bugs!
